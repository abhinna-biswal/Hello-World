This is a Tensorflow implemention of Deep Learning concept. TensorFlow is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks available. It's used for everything from cutting-edge machine learning research to building new features for the hottest start-ups in Silicon Valley. In this program, learn how TensorFlow is used to build a simple deep learning model. After this shows how to get TensorFlow up and running, this program demonstrates how to create and train a machine learning model, as well as how to leverage visualization tools to analyze and improve your model. Finally, this program demonstrates how to deploy models locally or in the cloud. At the end, you'll be ready to start building and deploying your own models with TensorFlow.
